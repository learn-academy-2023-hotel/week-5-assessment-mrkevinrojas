# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What does it mean to implement a TDD workflow?

Your answer: To write a test before writing a code that will fulfill that test.

Researched answer: Test Driven Development where tests are written before the actual code.  It is an approach to software development that promotes early detection of bugs, code confidence and improved design.

2. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: A relational database management system is used to create, update and manage relational databases.  The kinds of databases are Postgresql, oracle, etc..

Researched answer: It is a database that organizes data into tables, where each table consists of rows and columns.  Tables can be related to eachother based on common fields. MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Mircosfot SQL server, SQLite.

3. Why is an ORM?

Your answer: Object Relational Mapping is used in creating a bridge between OOP and relational databases like Ruby and PostgeSQL.

Researched answer: Object Relational Mapping which is a technique used in software development to bridge the gap between OOP and relational databases.  The goal is to allow developers to work with objects in thier programming language.  ORMs are used to simplify database interactions in applications and reduce the amount of repitive code.

4. STRETCH: What is the difference between inheritance in JavaScript and inheritance in Ruby?

Researched answer: JS uses prototype-based inheritance where objects inherit from other objects and Ruby uses class-based inheritance, where objects are instances of classes.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Model validations: Ensure that the data entered into the model meets specific criteria before it is saved to databases.  This prevents inconsistent data and that data remain accurate throughout the application.

2. Params:  Refers to Hash that holds the data from both the query string and the POST parameters.  In web development, it refers to the data passed along with an HTTP request and in order to access them depends on the web framework and programming language being used.  

3. API:  Application Programming Interface is a set of rules and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.  Methods and data formats are defined.  It plays a crucial rold in enabling the integrations of different systems.
